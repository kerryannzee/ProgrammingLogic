<h1> Kerry Ashburn -- This is the first lab for IT-2310 Web Programming </h1>

<p>This will serve as my first webpage in about twenty years. When I was in middle school in the late nineties/early aughts, creating webpages was one of my<br>
     favorite things to do. I created many sites on AngelFire. Unfortunately, they have all been disabled. </p>

<p>MySpace became a thing when I was in high school and I could focus on editing my MySpace page with HTML code. In addition to my MySpcae page, I could also use HTML <br>
    to make my LiveJournal profile more exciting. Kids these days have no idea how easy they have it, haha. </p>

<ul> My interests include:
    <li>Reading</li>
    <li>Random drives</li>
    <li>Music</li>
    <li>Puzzles</li>
    <li>Crosswords</li>
</ul>

<a href='https://www.w3schools.com/'>W3 Schools</a> is a site I frequently use.
